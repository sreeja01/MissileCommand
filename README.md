# MissileCommand
Missile Command is a game in which meteors are falling from the sky and we shoot missiles from land inorder to blast that meteor and save our city. It is most often associated with its use in video games. The game is staged as a series of levels of increasing difficulty; each level contains a set number of incoming enemy weapons. The weapons attack the six cities, as well as the missile batteries; being struck by an enemy weapon results in destruction of the city or missile battery. Different methods are used to increment the score and to quit the game.
